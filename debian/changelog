ros-hydro-catkinized-libav (0.0.1-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Merge commit 'e3b1bba6165b7e6e75b9ae3b4c58ffb9a94324e0' as 'catkinized_libav/libav_trunk'
  * Removed libav submodule
  * Corrected maintainer's in packages
  * Disabled x264 support in libav since it can mess up compilation and we don't need it for depth image transfer
  * Cleaned up the catkinized_libav cmake file a bit
  * Added install targets for catkinized_libav
  * Trying to add the install targets correctly, still need to copy the symlinks
  * Changed the cmake to work with submodules instead of cloning
  * Change the branch of libav to 9.8
  * Added libav as a submodule
  * Added the necessary build depends in package.xml
  * Added the catkinized libav package
  * Contributors: Nils Bore
